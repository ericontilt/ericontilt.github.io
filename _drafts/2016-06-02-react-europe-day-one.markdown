title: React Europe Day 1
---
Today was the first day of ReactEurope 2016 in Paris! It was super exciting to be there and the first conference day did not disappoint (even though I somehow
missed breakfast, grr). This is an attempt to provide a subjective overview of my first day.

## Dan Abramov - The Redux Journey

Dan Abramov kicked off with a nice overview of the current state of Redux and some thoughts about the future. I've actually had a chance to take a deep-dive into the presented material during the preceding two workshop days (which I can recommend to future visitors).

What I found most interesting were his own thoughts on the present state of Redux. That it's not the *only* solution to building React apps, despite it's popularity. It's also not necessarily supposed to be applied as strictly as presented in the documentation. In fact, use as much of it as you feel comfortable with, because it does incur some added complexity as a tradeoff for less boilerplate. All solid tips!

His closing message was the best though: (http://bit.ly/1Wy1TmH)[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux] is his new *free* course released on egghead.io, which is a follow-up to his (http://bit.ly/1T8fAmI)[Getting Started with React] course. Thanks Dan!

## Lin Clark - A cartoon guide to performance in React

I had never heard of Lin Clark. And yet, her talk was one of *the* best talks of the day.

Starting off she immediately mentioned there would probably not be any new information. And she was probably right considering the attending crowd. Nonetheless I'm sure that plenty of people out there aren't so familiar with the the details about the performance of React (or how to influence it), and this was such a pleasant way of presenting it.

She spoke very clearly, used neat cartoons to clarify the material and broke down the topic into easily digestible bits. Visit (https://code-cartoons.com/)[her site] and take a look at her cartoon guides to flux, redux, relay, etc. All very good stuff!

## Christopher Chedeau - Being Successful at Open Source

Christopher hardly needs an introduction as he's been the host of ReactEurope for all editions. His overuse of the word 'like' is made up by his good sense of humor and it's just a joy to listen to him. He presented some of his key learnings on making OSS successful:

* Ask your users the right question: how can we improve? vs. how is it broken?
* Whichever medium you pick (GitHub, IRC, Discord, etc.), be available
* Blog posts give a developer (or project) visibility

Definitely go watch his talk when the recording is released.

## Mihail Diordiev - Debugging flux applications in production

Mihail talked about the new release of the Redux dev tools. And it was a lot to digest. There's the new browser extensions, there are command line tools, Atom editor integration, time travel, device sync, unit test generation from action history, and then some.. Must watch..

## Cheng Lou - On the Spectrum of Abstraction

This is one I'm going to have to watch again. But it was both entertaining and  turned out to be a thoughtful analysis of the current JS landscape. Cheng talked about the relationship between level of abstraction, expressiveness and dependency bloat.

He gave a clever look at the ever changing JS landscape, and how to navigate it in the future. Highly recommended.

## Conclusion

I'm not (yet) a React Native guy, so those talks kind of went by me. Both the GraphQL and Flow talks were very interesting, but I have little to no experience with both of those technologies (time for some experimentation now!). What about your experience? If you somehow find this blog, please let me know!
